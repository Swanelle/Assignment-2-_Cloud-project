Project Title:
CloudBiz CM: A Cloud-Based Solution for the Digital Management of Small Businesses in Cameroon

Abstract:
The CloudBiz CM project is an initiative designed to digitalize the management of small businesses in Cameroon through cloud computing and WAN technologies. In many popular neighborhoods of Yaound√© and Douala, small business owners still rely on manual record-keeping using notebooks to track sales, which often leads to data loss and limited visibility of their activities.

As a young CEO of a digital solutions company, I identified this problem and developed CloudBiz CM, a mobile and web application hosted in the cloud. This solution enables merchants to record sales, monitor stock levels, manage debts, and access daily business reports anytime and anywhere.

Thanks to cloud hosting, all data is automatically saved, easily accessible, and protected from loss. The WAN (Wide Area Network), through the Internet, ensures communication between the application and the server, allowing real-time data synchronization.

The project will be deployed in four phases: development, pilot testing, official launch, and maintenance. Key partners such as MTN Cameroon, Orange Digital Center, and MINPOSTEL will be engaged to support the implementation, training, and distribution of the platform among users.

The main objective of CloudBiz CM is to make business management simpler, safer, and more modern while promoting digital inclusion and the economic empowerment of youth and women. In the long term, this solution could expand to other African countries and become a major driver of digital transformation for local micro-enterprises.
